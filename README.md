### Description: 
Currently, the web file-manager that CompleteFTP supports is based on the elFiner file manager (see [here](https://enterprisedt.com/products/completeftp/doc/guide/html/howtousefilemanager.html)).

However, it's possible that you can replace that one by another specific file-mananger called [angular file-manager](https://github.com/joni2back/angular-filemanager). 

We would like to recommned you to try it out as it's a more modern, multilingual file-manager and a better solution for mobile. 

So you might need to:

**1.** Try the new file-manager (i.e. *angular file-manager*) out first to see how it works by installing it side by side with the existing file-manager (i.e. *elFiner file-manager*).

**2.** After evaluating the new file-manager, if it's what you prefer, replace the existing one by it.

The following step-by-step instructions will show you how to do that.

### Steps for installing the angular file-manager side by side with the existing one:

**1.** First, clone the repository of the angular file-manager [here](https://github.com/EnterpriseDT/completeftp-filemanager).

**2.** Then launch the *CompleteFTP Manager* and go to the *Folders* panel.

**4.** When the *Select a folder* dialog appears, select the cloned folder (i.e. *completeftp-filemanager*) in the Windows file-system and press *OK* button.

**5.** (Optional) Change the name of the newly created folder to whatever you like by clicking the ellipsis button of the *Name* property, typing a name (e.g. *NewFileManager*) and pressing *OK* button.

Note: in case you want to revert back to use the old file-manager (i.e. *elFiner file-Manager*), just simply change the path of the *FileManager* folder to *C:\ProgramData\Enterprise Distributed Technologies\Complete FTP\FileManager* and don't forget to click *Apply Changes* button.
